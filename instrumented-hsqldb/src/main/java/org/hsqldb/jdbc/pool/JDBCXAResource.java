/**
 * Used by a global transaction service to control HSQLDB transactions.
 * Not for use by end-users.
 * End manage global transactions using transaction APIs such as JTA.
 * <P>
 * According to section 12.3 of the JDBC 3.0 spec, there is a
 * 1:1 correspondence between XAConnection and XAResource, and
 * <I>A given XAConnection object may be associated with at most one
 * transaction at a time</I>.
 * Therefore, there may be at any time at most one transaction
 * managed by a XAResource object.
 * One implication is, the XAResource can track the current transaction
 * state with a scalar.
 * Another implication is, the Xids for most of the XAResource interface
 * methods just introduce unnecessary complexity and an unnecessary point
 * of failure-- there can be only one transaction for this object, so
 * why track another identifier for it.
 * My strategy is to just "validate" that the Xid does not change
 * within a transaction.
 * Exceptions to this are the commit and rollback methods, which the
 * JDBC spec says can operate against any XAResource instance from
 * the same XADataSource.
 * N.b. The JDBC Spec does not state whether the prepare and forget
 * methods are XAResource-specific or XADataSource-specific.
