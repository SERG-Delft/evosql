 * Purpose of this class is to intercept and handle XA-related operations
 * according to chapter 12 of the JDBC 3.0 specification, by returning this
 * wrapped JDBCConnection to end-users.
 * Global transaction services and XAResources will not use this wrapper.
 * <P>
 * The new implementation extends JDBCConnection. A new object is created
 * based on the session / session proxy of the JDBCXAConnection object in the
 * constructor. (fredt)<p>
