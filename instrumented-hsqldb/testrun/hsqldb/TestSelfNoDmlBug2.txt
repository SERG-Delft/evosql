-- Tests a bug where with write_delay of 0, DML is not persisted until and 
-- if DML is committed or DB is "shutdown".  If DB stops with no shutdown,
-- all work is lost.

-- N.b. this test is unable to exhibit the problem because
-- (a) It doesn't show when data is being written to the .log file; and
-- (b) The test runner does a shutdown of some sort.  To reproduce 
--     problem manually, just Ctrl-C out of the session.
